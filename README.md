### This Python code produces LaTeX code for the equation images you provide. 

Put all the equation pictures in the same folder as this python file and set the folder path as ```folder_path = './'```.

Otherwise, set the folder path to the actual path in your computer where pictures of the equations are located.

For better results, keep equations separate by having only one equation (without the border) in one picture, as shown below.
